                    Organ transplantation is a life-saving procedure for patients with advanced or end-stage diseases.This dataset can be used to identify opportunities to improve current practice, build tools to help OPOs make better decisions, and recommend policy changes to increase procurement.
                    Downloaded the dataset from <a href="https://physionet.org/content/orchid/2.0.0/" target="_blank" style="color: aquamarine;text-decoration: none;">physionet</a> for learning purposes.

                <h2>Objective:</h2>
                <p>
                    To increase transplant opportunities for patients by enhancing the procurement process, I followed a structured data analytics approach:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Data Understanding & Preparation – </b>Examined the dataset to identify key variables, performed data cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies, and transformed the data for better usability.</li>
                        <li><b>Data Analysis & Processing – </b>Loaded the cleaned data, conducted detailed analysis, and explored patterns in the procurement process.</li>
                        <li><b>Insights & Visual Storytelling – </b>Generated meaningful insights and created visualizations to effectively increase the organ transplantation, highlighting key trends and correlations.</li>
                    </ul>  
                </p>

                <h3>Data Understanding</h3>
                <p><b>Tool Used: Jupyter Notebook</b></p>
                <p>Thoroughly reviewed the information available on PhysioNet to understand the data collection process. Here are some key observations:</p>
                <ui>
                    <li>The dataset is organized around the typical process of organ procurement at an OPO. There are six key steps in the procurement process: referral, evaluation, approach, authorization, procurement, and transplant.</li>
                    <li>ORCHID consists of ten tables, each of which is provided as a comma separated value (CSV) file. Tables are linked via a unique patient identifier, PatientID. Each table falls into one of three categories: OPO Referrals, OPO Events, and OPO Deaths.</li>
                    <li>After gaining a clear understanding of the data, performed the next step in the Data Analysis Process: Data Cleaning.</li>
                    <li>The code for the above step can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/Kalai-code/EDA_Projects/tree/main/ORCHID" target="_blank" style="color: aquamarine;text-decoration: none;">GitHub</a> repository.</li>
