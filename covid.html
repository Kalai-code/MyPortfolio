                <p>
                    This dataset is about pre-clinical COVID-19 data,based on survey responses collected from 294,106 Canadians from March 23rd until July 30th 2020, using a platform developed by Flatten, a Canadian non-profit organization.
                    Downloaded the dataset from <a href="https://physionet.org/content/flatten-covid-survey/1.0/" target="_blank" style="color: aquamarine;text-decoration: none;">physionet</a> for learning purposes.

                <h2>Objective:</h2>
                <p>
                    To analyze the impact of COVID-19 on mental health, I followed a structured data analytics approach:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Data Understanding & Preparation – </b>Examined the dataset to identify key variables, performed data cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies, and transformed the data for better usability.</li>
                        <li><b>Data Analysis & Processing – </b>Loaded the cleaned data, conducted statistical analysis, and explored patterns in mental health trends across different demographics and time periods.</li>
                        <li><b>Insights & Visual Storytelling – </b>Generated meaningful insights and created visualizations to effectively narrate the impact of COVID-19 on mental well-being, highlighting key trends and correlations.</li>
                    </ul>  
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="solution">
                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                <h3>Data Understanding</h3>
                <p><b>Tool Used: Jupyter Notebook</b></p>
                <p>I thoroughly reviewed the information available on PhysioNet to understand the data collection process. Here are some key observations:</p>
                <ui>
                    <li>The dataset consists of three CSV files located in the Flatten_Data folder, corresponding to three different survey schemas (Schema1, Schema2, and Schema3).</li>
                    <li>After downloading and inspecting the data, I found that Schema1 contains 263,639 records, Schema2 has 14,932 records, and Schema3 includes 15,534 records.</li>
                    <li>Additionally, I observed that a few columns were uniquely added to each schema, indicating potential variations in data attributes across surveys.</li>
                    <li>After gaining a clear understanding of the data, I merged all three CSV files into a single dataset to streamline the next step in the data analysis process: Data Cleaning.</li>
                    <li>The code for the above step can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/Kalai-code/EDA_Projects/tree/main/COVID19_Survey" target="_blank" style="color: aquamarine;text-decoration: none;">GitHub</a> repository.</li>
                </ui>
                <h3>Data Preparation & Data Cleaning</h3>
                <p><b>Tool Used: Microsoft PowerBI</b></p>
                <p>After gaining an understanding of the data, I proceeded with the cleaning process using Microsoft Power BI Desktop.</p>
                <ui>
                    <li>First, I loaded the merged CSV file from the previous step and selected the "Transform Data" option. I then performed various cleaning steps, including checking for blank rows and cross-validating values based on the algorithm outlined in PhysioNet.</li>
                    <li>A detailed document outlining the cleaning steps is available in the GitHub repository.</li>
                </ui>
                <h3>Insights & Visual Storytelling</h3>
                <p>Loaded the data after data cleaning and started with building Insights. Here are the observations:</p>
                <ui>
                    <li>The responders who stopped traveling have an impact of Mental health because of travel restrictions.</li>
                    <li>Responders who had covid symptoms(Fever,Chills,Cough,ShortnessOfBreath,Shakes) had a Negative Impact on Mental Health compared to other categories of Mental Health Impact.</li>
                    <li>The responders who self isolated had an impact of Negative Mental Health than those who had not self isolated. </li>
                    <li>When responders have medical conditions, they have more impact on Negative Mental Health compared to other categories.</li>
                    <li>The survey responders had more Negative Impact on Mental Health on all the categories of Needs. Emotional support was the cause for negative MH impact.</li>
                </ui>

                <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that a developed country like Canada can even  remain vulnerable to public health emergencies with significant health and other socio-economic impacts. People were affected mentally with scarcity of various daily needs.</p>
