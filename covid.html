                    This dataset is about pre-clinical COVID-19 data,based on survey responses collected from 294,106 Canadians from March 23rd until July 30th 2020, using a platform developed by Flatten, a Canadian non-profit organization.
                    Downloaded the dataset from <a href="https://physionet.org/content/flatten-covid-survey/1.0/" target="_blank" style="color: aquamarine;text-decoration: none;">physionet</a> for learning purposes.

                <p>
                    To analyze the impact of COVID-19 on mental health, I followed a structured data analytics approach:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Data Understanding & Preparation – </b>Examined the dataset to identify key variables, performed data cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies, and transformed the data for better usability.</li>
                        <li><b>Data Analysis & Processing – </b>Loaded the cleaned data, conducted statistical analysis, and explored patterns in mental health trends across different demographics and time periods.</li>
                        <li><b>Insights & Visual Storytelling – </b>Generated meaningful insights and created visualizations to effectively narrate the impact of COVID-19 on mental well-being, highlighting key trends and correlations.</li>
                    </ul>  
                </p>

                <h3>Data Understanding & Preparation:</h3>
                <p><b>Tool Used: Jupyter Notebook</b></p>
                <p>I thoroughly reviewed the information available on PhysioNet to understand the data collection process. Here are some key observations:</p>
                <ui>
                    <li>The dataset consists of three CSV files located in the Flatten_Data folder, corresponding to three different survey schemas (Schema1, Schema2, and Schema3).</li>
                    <li>After downloading and inspecting the data, I found that Schema1 contains 263,639 records, Schema2 has 14,932 records, and Schema3 includes 15,534 records.</li>
                    <li>Additionally, I observed that a few columns were uniquely added to each schema, indicating potential variations in data attributes across surveys.</li>
                    <li>After gaining a clear understanding of the data, I merged all three CSV files into a single dataset to streamline the next step in the data analysis process: Data Cleaning.</li>
                    <li>The code for the above step can be found in my <a href="https://physionet.org/content/flatten-covid-survey/1.0/" target="_blank" style="color: aquamarine;text-decoration: none;">GitHub</a> repository.</li>
