                    This dataset is about pre-clinical COVID-19 data,based on survey responses collected from 294,106 Canadians from March 23rd until July 30th 2020, using a platform developed by Flatten, a Canadian non-profit organization.
                    Downloaded the dataset from <a href="https://physionet.org/content/flatten-covid-survey/1.0/" target="_blank">physionet</a> for learning purposes.

                    To analyze the impact of COVID-19 on mental health, I followed a structured data analytics approach:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Data Understanding & Preparation – </b>Examined the dataset to identify key variables, performed data cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies, and transformed the data for better usability.</li>
                        <li><b>Data Analysis & Processing – </b>Loaded the cleaned data, conducted statistical analysis, and explored patterns in mental health trends across different demographics and time periods.</li>
                        <li><b>Insights & Visual Storytelling – </b>Generated meaningful insights and created visualizations to effectively narrate the impact of COVID-19 on mental well-being, highlighting key trends and correlations.</li>
                    </ul>
